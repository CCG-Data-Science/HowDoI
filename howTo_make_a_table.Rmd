Suppose were investigating the iris data set that comes with R:

Let us load into our R session

```{r}
data(iris)
```

and see what we have got:

```{r}
str(iris)
```

To show this as a table, you type:

```
Variable|type|Unit
--------|----|----
sepal length | numeric | mm
sepal width | numeric | mm
petal length | numeric | mm
petal width | numeric | mm
```

which, once you knit the file, renders as 

Variable|type|Unit
--------|----|----
sepal length | numeric | mm
sepal width | numeric | mm
petal length | numeric | mm
petal width | numeric | mm
